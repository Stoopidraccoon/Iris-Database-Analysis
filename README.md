# Iris-Database-Analysis
Exploratory analysis and visualization of the Iris dataset using Power BI 

# Task Objective

The goal of this task was to:
- Understand how to load and explore a simple dataset.
- Visualize key insights using data visualization techniques.
- Practice basic data analysis skills in which I have used Power BI by creating interactive visual report.
  

# Dataset Used

**Dataset** Iris dataset available on Kaggle 
It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.  
Each row includes:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species 



# My Approach

1. **Data Loading**
   - The dataset was loaded and cleaned in Power BI.
   - No missing values or duplicates were found.

2. **Visualizations Created:**
   - **Scatter Plot**: To analyze relationships between Petal Length and Petal Width.
   - **Histogram**: To observe the distribution of Sepal Length.
   - **Box Plot**: To detect outliers and see the spread of Sepal Width across species.
   - **Donut Chart**: To show class distribution of different species.
   - **Line Chart**: To track average Sepal Length per species
   - **Cards**: Key metrics like Maximum Petal Length, Maximum Sepal Length, and Count of each Species.
   - **Slicer**: To filter visualizations by species.

3. **Theme and Color Palette:**
   - Soft, nature-inspired colors were used to reflect the dataset's floral theme.
   - Consistent layout for easy readability.


# Results and Insights

- **Species Distribution**: Each of the three iris species has equal number of samples (50 each).
- **Petal Length vs Width**: Shows a clear pattern distinguishing the three species.
- **Sepal Measurements**: Variance is higher in virginica species.
- **Outliers**: A few outliers were found in Sepal Width using the box plot.
- **Trends**: Average Sepal and Petal Length increased from setosa to virginica.
